Fork this repository and follow the instructions in `NaiveBayes.ipynb`.

### My Notes on the Assignment
This assignment challenged me to use create a fully functional classification model using the Naive Bayes algorithm. This model classifies tweets as either *positive, negative, neutral, or irrelevant*. It also provides a heat-map visualization for you to peruse using the Google Maps API. Take a look at the `NaiveBayes.ipynb` file to walk through the assignment in its entirety, as well as to see my work. 

#### Visualization Use
To see the visualization for yourself, first navigate [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) and create your own Google Maps API key (for security, I did not commit mine to GitHub). Then navigate to the `index.html` file found in the `public_html` folder. In that file, replace the `APIKEY` placeholder with your own API key. Then run through the whole Jupyter Notebook file to generate your visualization.
